# 🧑‍💻 RavenCo – Developer Contribution Guidelines

Welcome, builder. ❤️  
RavenCo is a fully peer-to-peer, encrypted messaging platform. No servers. No metadata. No ads.  
Just raw, local-first communication tech — made by people like **you**.

We’re building this in the open, and you’re invited to help.

- 📞 WebRTC audio/video setup and enhancements
- 💾 Local storage: file management, chat history, offline handling
- 🌐 Signaling layer improvements (temporary server, QR bootstraps, etc.)
- 📱 Platform support: iOS / Android builds
- 🧪 Testing tools / security audits / protocol reviews
- 🧩 Plugin support or modular features
- 🐞 Bug fixes, cleanups, and code refactors
- ⚙️ CI/CD setup or GitHub Actions automation

## 🚀 Get Started Quickly

1. **Fork the repo**
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MeloChat.git
   cd RavenCo
3. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
4. Work on your contribution
5. Push & open a pull request

## 💡 Contribution Rules
- Keep it privacy-first: no telemetry, analytics, or external tracking libraries.
- No third-party services without full local fallback.
- No monetization logic or donation popups.
- Encrypt before you send. Decrypt only on device. Period.
- Keep UI accessible and lightweight.

## 🏷️ Labeling Contributions
When opening a pull request:
- Add a descriptive title
- Use appropriate tags (feature, bug, refactor, docs)
- Reference any related issue:
  - ```Closes #12``` or `Fixes #8`

## 🛡️ Security / Privacy Note
This project is built on trust. If you're contributing crypto, WebRTC, or storage code:
- Provide citations or references for any custom implementations
- Avoid black-box code — clarity > cleverness
- Help us review security together

## 🏆 How We Reward Contributors

You may not use RavenCo or its forks to build a paid product, ad-supported app, or monetized SaaS platform. Ever.

## 🧠 Build Smart, Build Free
We're here to create a new kind of communication — not just a clone of WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram but something open, flexible, secure, and dev-first.  

Thanks for building with us. Let’s make something meaningful.
